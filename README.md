# Analytics-Projects
A collection of Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, and related projects.

These are some of the projects I worked on as part of my concentration in data analytics at SNHU Online while attending the BSc Cybersecurity program.
These projects are from several of the classes I will list below, which I will attempt to keep updated as I progress through my program.

DAT-223
DAT-325
DAT-375
MAT-303
*more to come*

Beware: SNHU uses turnit-in anti plagiarism technology to screen submissions, so if you are just raw copying and pasting these results, it will likely not
  have a good outcome. I am posting this purely to showcase my own efforts and to try and validate my experience(s). While I received almost perfect scores on
  all of my work, I would only use these as a reference point, otherwise, what are you really learning? Draw your own conclusions, come up with your own
  results.
